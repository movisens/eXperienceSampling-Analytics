#### Explore

Radiant is interactive. Results update immediately when inputs are changed (i.e., no separate dialog boxes). This greatly facilitates exploration and understanding of the data.

#### Cross-platform

Radiant works on Windows, Mac, or Linux. It can run without an Internet connection and no data will leave your computer. You can also run the app as a web application on a server.

#### Reproducible

Simply saving output is not enough. You need the ability to recreate results for the same data and/or when new data become available. Moreover, others may want to review your analysis and results. Save and load the state of the application to continue your work at a later time or on another computer. Share state files with others and create reproducible reports using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). See also the section on `Saving and loading state` below

If you are using Radiant on a server you can even share the url (include the SSUID) with others so they can see what you are working on. Thanks for this feature go to [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5).

#### Programming

Although Radiant's web-interface can handle quite a few data and analysis tasks, at times you may prefer to write your own code. Radiant provides a bridge to programming in R(studio) by exporting the functions used for analysis. For more information about programming with Radiant see the [programming](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/programming.html) page on the documentation site.

#### Context

Radiant focuses on business data and decisions. It offers tools, examples, and documentation relevant for that context, effectively reducing the business analytics learning curve.


## How to install Radiant

- Required: [R](http://cran.rstudio.com/) version 3.2 or later
- Required: A modern browser (e.g., [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/) or Safari). Internet Explorer (version 11 or higher) should work as well
- Recommended: [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Radiant is available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/radiant/index.html). To install the latest version with complete documentation for off-line access open R(studio) and copy-and-paste the command below:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages(c("lme4", "mnormt", "MathJaxR", "rpivotTable", "shinyAce"), repos = "http://vnijs.github.io/radiant_miniCRAN/")
devtools::install_github('movisens/eXperienceSampling-Analytics')
```

If you want to update packages (e.g., after upgrading R) use:

```r
update.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE, ask = FALSE, type = "binary", repos = "http://vnijs.github.io/radiant_miniCRAN/")
```

Once all packages are installed (updated) use the commands below to launch the app (use either "xs", "base", "quant", or "marketing"):

```r
library(radiant)
radiant()
```

See also the `Installing Radiant` video:

You can create a launcher on your Desktop to start Radiant by typing `launcher("marketing")` in the R-console and pressing return. A file called `radiant.bat` (windows) or `radiant.command` (mac) will be created that you can double-click to start Radiant in your default browser.

When Radiant starts you will see data on diamond prices. To close the application click on `Quit` in the Navigation bar and then click the `Quit` button on the left of the screen. The Radiant process will stop and the browser window will close (or gray-out).

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials are available at <http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/> and in the Radiant web interface (the `?` icons and the `Help` menu).

Want some help getting started? Watch the tutorials on the [documentation site](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/tutorials.html)

## Reporting issues

Please use the GitHub issue tracker at <a href="https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/issues" target="_blank">github.com/vnijs/radiant/issues</a> if you have any problems with Radiant.

## Online

Not ready to install Radiant on your computer? Try it online at the links below:

<a href="https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/base" target="_blank">vnijs.shinyapps.io/base</a>

<a href="https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/quant" target="_blank">vnijs.shinyapps.io/quant</a>

<a href="https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/marketing" target="_blank">vnijs.shinyapps.io/marketing</a>

## Running Radiant on shinyapps.io / shiny-server

You can run Radiant on a (linux) server. See links above as evidence. There are also (slightly older) instances you can access that will not affect my personal usage of shinyapps.io:

<a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/base" target="_blank">gallery.shinyapps.io/base</a>

<a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/quant" target="_blank">gallery.shinyapps.io/quant</a>

<a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/marketing" target="_blank">gallery.shinyapps.io/marketing</a>

To run your own server instance copy/fork the repo from github and [deploy to shinyapps.io as usual](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html). Shinyapps.io may complain about paths but you shouldnâ€™t have any trouble if you know how to deploy to shinyapps.io. You can also host Radiant using [shiny-server](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/). Just point shiny-server to the directory in inst/ you want to use. As a courtesy, please let me know if you intend to use on a server.

## Saving and loading state

To save your analyses save the state of the app to a file (Data > Manage). You can open this state file at a later time or on another computer to continue where you left off. You can also share the file with others that may want to replicate your analyses. As an example, load the state_file [`RadiantState.rda`](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/blob/master/inst/examples/RadiantState.rda?raw=true) in the `examples` folder. Go to `Data > View`, `Data > Visualize` to see some of the settings. There is also a report in `R > Report` that was created using the Radiant interface. The html file [`RadiantState.html`](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/blob/master/inst/examples/RadiantState.html?raw=true) contains the output.

A related feature in Radiant is that state is maintained if you accidentally navigate to another page, close (and reopen) the browser, and/or hit refresh. Use Quit > Reset to return to a clean/new state.

Loading and saving state also works with Rstudio. If you start Radiant from Rstudio and use Quit > Quit to stop the app, lists called `r_data` and `r_state` will be put into Rstudio's global workspace. If you start radiant again using `radiant()` it will use these lists to restore state. This can be convenient if you want to make changes to a data file in Rstudio and load it back into Radiant. Also, if you load a state file directly into Rstudio it will be used when you start Radiant to recreate a previous state.

**Technical note**: The way loading state works in Radiant is as follows: When an input is initialized in a Shiny app you set a default value in the call to, for example, numericInput. In Radiant, when a state file has been loaded and an input is initialized it looks to see if there is a value for an input of that name in a list called `r_state`. If there is, this value is used. The `r_state` list is created when saving state using `reactiveValuesToList(input)`. An example of a call to numericInput is given below where the `state_init` function from `radiant.R` is used to check if a value from `r_state` can be used. `sm_args$comp_value` is the default value specified in the `single_mean` function call.

```r
numericInput("sm_comp_value", "Comparison value:", state_init('sm_comp_value',sm_args$comp_value))
```

## Source code

The source code is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/vnijs/radiant>. Three (related) apps are included in the inst/ directory. `Base`, offers data loading, saving, viewing, visualizing, merging, and transforming tools. The `quant` app sources the code from base and extends it. This app is used in the _Quantitative Analysis_ class at the Rady School of Management (UCSD). Finally, the `marketing` app sources the code from `base` and `quant` and extends it with additional tools. The `quant` app focuses on (basic) quantitative analysis (e.g., comparing means, regression, etc.). The `marketing` app focuses on marketing analytics by adding clustering, principle component analysis, conjoint analysis, etc. This app is used in the _Research for Marketing Decisions_ class at Rady (UCSD).
